This C++ program implements a two-player game where each player takes turns entering a number between 1 and 6. The computer randomly generates its own number within the same range, which remains hidden from the players. If a player's input matches the hidden computer's number, the game ends, and the player's total score is displayed. Player scores accumulate based on the sum of their correct guesses. Should a player input a number outside the valid range (1 to 6), the program prompts them to try again. After a predefined number of turns, the final scores of both players are compared, and the player with the higher score is declared the winner. The program utilizes a basic loop structure, conditional statements, and user input validation to manage the game flow, calculate scores, and determine the ultimate winner
